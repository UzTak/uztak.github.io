I am a Ph.D. student at <b>Stanford University, Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics</b>. 
Currently I am working at [Stanford Space Rendezvous Laboratory](https://slab.stanford.edu/), advised by Dr. Simone D'Amico. 
I have also been receiving a full-ride scholarship from [Ezoe Memorial Recruit Foundation](https://www.recruit-foundation.org/) since 2020.

初めまして！スタンフォード大学 航空宇宙学科博士課程の田久保勇志です。

The research question I want to answer is: <b>How to make an optimal decision-making in a complex system?</b> 
Particularly, I am interested in two aspects of ``complexity":
- <b>Uncertainty</b>: an environment is always stochastic and uncertain. How to perform optimization under uncertainty? 
- <b>Multi-objective space</b>: every decision-making problems has competing objectives (which are sometimes hidden). Can we seek the trade-space of multi-objective solution space to make a better decision? 

With my passion in space, I am currently working on spacecraft autonomy & intelligence in the context of distributed space systems (formation flight, rendezvous, proximity operations, and docking (RPOD)). 

Research Fields:
- Control and Autonomy
- Optimization 
- Astrodynamics 

Past Research Topics:
- Space Logistics (operations research in space) with Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning 
- Co-design of spacecraft and space logistics via Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO)
- Trade-space analysis of Low-energy Transfer in the Sun-Earth-Moon four-body system with low-thrust propulsion
- Multi-objective Moon Tour design in the Multi-Moon System (Saturn & Jupiter)
- Robust multi-objective guidance of Supersonic Transport (SST) under wind uncertainty
- Optimal control in the probability moment space / Covariance Steering
