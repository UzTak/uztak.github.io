My new first-authored paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14996">"Automated Tour Design in the Saturnian System"</a> was selected for the Winter 2023 <a href="https://www.space-flight.org/docs/Breakwell/Breakwell_award.html">Breakwell Student Paper Award</a> at the <a href="https://www.space-flight.org/docs/2023_winter/2023_winter.html">33rd AAS/AIAA Space Flight Mechanics Conference 2023</a>, which will be held at Austin, TX in coming January. 

The paper discusses the multi-moon tour design in the unique dynamical system around Saturn, unveiling a multi-objective trade-space for the Enceladus mission. The optimal trajectories contain dozens of flybys at each moon (Titan, Rhea, Dione, Tethys, and Enceladus) in order to reduce the energy efficiently, and the proposed method efficiently optimizes this mixed discrete-continuous problem based on dynamic programming. This paper is based on the research collaboration I had with NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory this past summer. 

I will also be awarded $1,000 of the travel fund in order to participate in the conference. Financial support for (independent) undergraduate scholars is a severe issue, and I deeply appreciate this great support from the American Astronautical Society (AAS). Super excited to meet with talented scholars at Austin next month!
